"""Build shim that vendors the agent skills into the package at build time.

All project metadata lives in pyproject.toml; this file only adds a build step.
The canonical skills source is the repo-root ``lemma-skills/`` (the backend and
Dockerfiles read it directly), so we copy it into ``lemma_cli/skills/`` whenever
we build — for both the sdist (run from the source tree, where the source is
available) and the wheel (often built from the unpacked sdist, where the source
is absent but the files are already vendored in).

This makes a bare ``uv build`` / ``python -m build`` ship the skills with no
separate sync step, and fails the build loudly rather than ever publishing an
empty ``lemma_cli/skills/`` (which is exactly how lemma-terminal 0.4.1 shipped
without skills).
