"""Telegram delivery-mode resolution.

Telegram can receive updates two ways: a public HTTPS webhook (the default) or a
native long-poll receiver (``ENABLE_TELEGRAM_POLLING_MODE``, for runtimes
without a public URL). The webhook-vs-polling decision was previously duplicated
across the surface service and controller; centralize it here.
