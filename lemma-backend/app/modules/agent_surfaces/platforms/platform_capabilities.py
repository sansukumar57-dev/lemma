"""Per-platform capability registry — the single source of truth for what a
surface platform can do and how the agent should behave on it.

This registry powers three things:
  * the standing per-platform system-prompt fragment (``platform_agent_guidance``)
    that makes the agent aware it is conversing on a third-party platform and how
    its messages/files/forms are delivered there;
  * the channel-background-context wording reinforced in that fragment;
  * the delivery branch in the ``display_resource`` tool (chat vs email, native
    form vs link, native file vs link).

Byte caps are reused from :mod:`attachment_limits` rather than duplicated.
