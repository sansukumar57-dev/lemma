"""Composio-backed transport for email surface platforms.

Email surfaces (Gmail, Outlook) can be connected through either the native
(LEMMA) provider or Composio. Composio never exposes the underlying provider
OAuth token — it proxies API calls behind a connected-account id — so a
Composio-backed surface cannot call the Microsoft Graph / Gmail REST APIs
directly. Instead it must run the equivalent Composio operation
(``OUTLOOK_REPLY_EMAIL``, ``GMAIL_REPLY_TO_THREAD`` ...).

This module centralises:
- detecting whether a resolved credentials payload is Composio-backed, and
- executing a Composio operation with those credentials.

The platform services branch on :func:`is_composio_credentials` and dispatch the
provider I/O either here (Composio) or through their native httpx path.
