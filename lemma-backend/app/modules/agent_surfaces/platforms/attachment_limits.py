"""Per-platform attachment size caps for surface file delivery.

Egress (``display_resource`` type=FILE and email replies) attaches a file's
bytes natively when the file is at or below the platform's cap, and otherwise
falls back to an app/public URL link. Inbound auto-ingest skips downloading
attachments larger than ``INBOUND_ATTACHMENT_BYTE_CAP``.

Caps are conservative approximations of each platform's documented limits; they
are the inline-vs-link threshold, not a hard API guarantee.
