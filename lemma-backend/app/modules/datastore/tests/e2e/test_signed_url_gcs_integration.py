"""Real-GCS integration test for public signed URLs (egress behavior).

Unlike ``test_signed_url_e2e.py`` (which runs on the local filesystem backend),
this drives the *actual* GCS object store so we exercise the real egress path:
the file is uploaded to GCS, and ``GET /s/{code}`` streams those bytes back from
GCS *through the backend* — which is precisely what makes the hit cap bound
egress (a raw object-store signed URL would bypass it).

Gated: set ``LEMMA_GCS_ITEST_BUCKET`` to a writable GCS bucket and have GCS
credentials available (ADC or a service account). Without it the test is skipped
so normal CI never reaches the cloud. It still needs the e2e infra containers
(Postgres/Redis/SuperTokens) like every other e2e test.

NOTE on V4 signed URLs: the authenticated ``GET .../files/url`` download URL on
GCS is a real object-signed URL, which requires a *service-account* signer. With
plain user ADC (``authorized_user``) signing fails at the IAM ``signBlob`` step,
so this test does not assert that path — the deployed backend (workload identity
/ service account) covers it. The public ``/s/{code}`` path needs only read
access and is what we verify here.
