"""E2E tests for datastore file search and document conversion.

The conversion path runs against ONE real arXiv paper (the lightest,
``seq2seq``, under tests/fixtures/arxiv/) so conversion + full-text/vector/hybrid
search exercise genuine extracted text. The paper is paired in ``harness.PAPERS``
with a needle phrase that Kreuzberg reliably extracts (verified empirically), so
search assertions stay deterministic.

Real-PDF extraction is deliberately minimized to a single light paper across the
whole module: the session-scoped Kreuzberg test container has no restart policy,
and extracting several figure-heavy real PDFs OOM-crashes it, after which every
later extraction (even tiny ``.md`` files in other tests) fails with
ConnectionRefused. The directory-scope matrix is therefore driven by lightweight
``.md`` files — PATH-based scoping needs no real PDF content, ``.md`` files index
fast (no OCR/image extraction), and their needles are fully controlled.

Coverage:
  - CONVERSION: the real PDF exposes hidden child files — ``document.md`` (needle
    + native page markers), figure assets, and on-demand page renders — fetched
    full and page-wise by their ``<source-path>/<artifact>`` paths; a ``.md``
    file has no derived children.
  - SEARCH (TEXT/VECTOR/HYBRID): the paper's needle returns its file id.
  - DIRECTORY-SCOPED SEARCH: the PDF plus ``.md`` notes laid across a folder
    tree, with SUBTREE vs DIRECT scoping asserted deterministically by querying
    each in-scope file's own needle (matches driven by folder scope, not noise).
  - CONSISTENCY THROUGH MUTATION: move follows search; folder delete removes
    files from search.
  - LITERAL wildcard-char scope paths and personal /me-file searchability.

The conversion / scoped-search / move-delete assertions share a single indexed
corpus and form a step-N-depends-on-N-1 chain, so they live in one named test
rather than re-indexing the (slow, memory-heavy) real PDF per assertion.
