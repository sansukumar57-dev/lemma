"""Host-based routing for public app builds.

An app is served at ``<public_slug>.<app_base_domain>`` (e.g.
``my-app.127-0-0-1.sslip.io:8711`` locally, ``my-app.apps.lemma.work`` in
cloud). This middleware inspects the request ``Host`` header and, when it
matches an app subdomain, rewrites the request onto the public app asset
endpoint (``/public/apps``) and surfaces the slug via the
``X-App-Public-Slug`` header — the same contract the cloud nginx ingress uses.

This lets the backend serve apps by host with no reverse proxy locally, and
keeps a single code path in the controller (slug always arrives as a header).
Requests that already carry ``X-App-Public-Slug`` (i.e. proxied by nginx)
pass through untouched so the cloud path is unchanged.
