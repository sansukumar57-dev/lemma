    Run a shell command in the private conversation workspace.

    Use this for repo inspection, builds, tests, and file edits through standard CLI commands.
    The workspace injects Lemma environment variables for the current user/pod, so
    `lemma ...` CLI commands may be used for pod operations when the task calls for
    them. Do not use raw localhost probes to diagnose host Lemma API/Auth
    availability: the command runs inside an isolated workspace, so `localhost` is
    the workspace container, not the host backend.
    The workspace is a sandbox: files created here are not directly visible to the
    user. Upload final deliverables to pod files under `/me/...` with `lemma files
    upload` before presenting or referencing them as user-accessible files.

    Modes:
    - One-shot (`tty=false`, default): returns after a short initial wait. Quick commands complete normally;
      long-running commands return `process_id` instead of blocking the agent.
    - Interactive (`tty=true`): starts a real TTY terminal process and returns `process_id` for follow-up input.
    - Commands run in the workspace container directly; no sandbox/escalation fields are used here.

    Interactive workflow (for commands like `npm run dev`):
    1) Start with `tty=true`:
       `{"cmd":"npm run dev","tty":true,"yield_time_ms":1000}`
    2) Continue with `manage_process` using the returned `process_id`:
       - poll output: `{"action":"input","process_id":"...","chars":"","yield_time_ms":1000}`
       - send input: `{"action":"input","process_id":"...","chars":"q\\n"}`
       - stop it: `{"action":"kill","process_id":"..."}`

    Use `manage_process` with `{"action":"list"}` before starting another
    long-running server or when you need to find a process started earlier.

    Editing files via CLI example:
    - Overwrite file:
      `{"cmd":"cat > src/config.json <<'EOF'\\n{\\\"mode\\\":\\\"dev\\\"}\\nEOF"}`
    - Append line:
      `{"cmd":"echo 'export DEBUG=1' >> .env.local"}`
