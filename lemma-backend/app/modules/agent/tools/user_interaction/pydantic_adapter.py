    Display a user-facing resource or richer interaction.

    Prefer this tool whenever the user would benefit from seeing, inspecting, or
    acting on something instead of receiving prose only. Text is good for brief
    narration, but users often want a concrete surface:
    - asking a multiple-choice question: use the `ask_user` tool. For richer or
      free-form structured input (several typed fields at once), render a WIDGET.
    - showing complex data, charts, previews, or custom visuals: render a WIDGET
      instead of dumping dense text.
    - creating or updating pod resources: display the created or changed AGENT,
      FUNCTION, WORKFLOW, APP, SCHEDULE, TABLE, or FILE instead of only saying
      that it was created.
    - showing datastore records or resource lists: display the TABLE or resource
      directly so the user can inspect it.

    Use this for every "show this to the user" action: pod files, datastore
    tables, agents, functions, workflows, apps, schedules, and widgets.

    Examples:
    - BROWSER: set type="BROWSER" only. This returns the same short-lived browser
      URL so the user can see the browser backed by the same user sandbox the agent controls with browser CLI
      commands.
    - FILE: set type="FILE" and path="/me/reports/report.pdf".
      First upload sandbox deliverables into pod files using `lemma files upload`.
      Do not pass private workspace paths.
    - TABLE: set type="TABLE", name="<table_name>", and optional filters. Omit
      name to display all tables. Use query only for read-only SQL against
      RLS-disabled tables.
    - AGENT/FUNCTION/WORKFLOW/APP/SCHEDULE: set type and optional name. Name is
      the unique pod resource name within that type. Omit name to display all
      resources of that type.
    - WIDGET: set type="WIDGET" and provide exactly one of public_url or content.
      Before your first widget in a conversation, silently load the `lemma-widget`
      skill and follow its guidance. A widget can collect structured input and
      submit it back to the chat — use one when `ask_user` choices aren't enough.

    This tool only displays or requests user-facing resources. User approval for
    potentially sensitive local harness actions remains the separate approval flow.
