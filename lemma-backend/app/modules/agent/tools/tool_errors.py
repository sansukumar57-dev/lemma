"""Shared helpers for turning tool-call failures into recoverable responses.

A single tool error must never abort an agent run. Both execution paths use these
helpers so they format and skip errors identically:

  * the in-process LEMMA harness wraps every toolset in ``GracefulToolset`` and
    returns ``format_tool_error`` instead of raising,
  * the daemon path (per-conversation / pod MCP services + the approval executor)
    catches dispatcher failures and returns the same payload as an MCP tool error
    (``CallToolResult(isError=True, ...)``).

``is_control_flow_exception`` marks the exceptions that are NOT tool failures —
pydantic-ai's retry/deferral/approval/limit signals and task cancellation — which
must always propagate so the framework can act on them.
