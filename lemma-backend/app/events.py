"""Worker event wiring and streaq task registration.

FastStream subscriptions and streaq tasks are registered from the module
registry: each module's ``event_routers()`` thunk imports its handlers, which
also registers any ``@streaq_task``/``@streaq_cron`` defined alongside them.

This runs at *import scope* on purpose: the worker entrypoint is
``streaq run app.events:streaq_worker``, so all tasks must be registered on the
shared ``streaq_worker`` before streaq introspects it, and all routers included
on the ``broker`` before ``broker.start()``.
