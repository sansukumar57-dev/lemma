"""Shared HTTP response builders for served HTML assets (apps and widgets).

Both the app and widget serving paths return an HTML document with pod context
injected, plus the same ETag / cache-control conventions for entrypoints vs
content-hashed static assets. These builders are the single place that logic
lives so the controllers only do routing, auth, and data-fetch.
