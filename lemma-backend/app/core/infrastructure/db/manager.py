        Used between tests so the schema (and any shared worker connections) stay
        alive while data is isolated. CASCADE handles FK order in one statement.

        Only tables that actually hold rows are truncated. A typical test touches
        a handful of tables, so this avoids taking an ACCESS EXCLUSIVE lock on the
        ~100 empty tables in the schema on every test — the dominant per-test DB
        cost. Emptiness is checked with a cheap ``EXISTS`` per table (instant on an
        empty relation), and CASCADE still empties anything referencing a dirty
        table, so isolation is unchanged.
