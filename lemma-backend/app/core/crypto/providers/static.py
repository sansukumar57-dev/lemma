"""Static key provider — keyring of raw Fernet keys from configuration.

The default backend for OSS and local stacks: keys live in env/config, crypto
happens in-process, and rotation is driven by adding a new primary key to the
keyset and re-encrypting forward (see :mod:`app.core.crypto.rotation`).
