"""The :class:`LemmaModule` contract.

A ``LemmaModule`` is a *declarative* description of what a module contributes to
the running system. Every contribution is a **zero-arg thunk** (a callable that
returns the heavy objects) rather than the objects themselves, so importing a
module's ``module.py`` is cheap and free of import cycles: the controllers and
event handlers are imported only when the relevant entrypoint calls the thunk,
by which point that entrypoint is already the active importer.

Enable/disable is by *list membership*: a module absent from the assembled list
is simply not wired. A separate deployment (``lemma-cloud``) composes its own
list = open-source core modules + extra proprietary ones, and reuses the same
assembly functions (see ``app/core/registry/assembly.py``).

Cross-module needs are expressed as **ports & adapters**, not through this
contract: a consumer module declares a port (Protocol/ABC) for what it needs;
the open-source build wires a default adapter and ``lemma-cloud`` overrides it
via ordinary dependency injection. There is deliberately no admin field and no
provider registry here.
