// weight. A `prompt` recipe is the lightweight end: it seeds the assistant with
// an intent and lets it build (an app, an agent, or a bot on a surface). A
// `repo` recipe is the heavyweight end: a published kit installed from a source.
// Surfaces and connectors aren't a separate genre — almost every recipe wires
// them, so the agent establishes that operating context as part of building.
