# Connectors

Connectors are the pod's hands in the outside world — Gmail, Slack, Notion, Google
Calendar, and the rest. A workload (function or agent) executes an **operation**
against a third-party app on the **invoking user's behalf**, never touching raw
credentials. So an agent that "sends an email" is really running one delegated
operation through that user's connected account.

> commands.

## The model, for connectors

Four entities stack up — find the one you need and address it by **name**:

1. **Connector** — a catalog entry: `gmail`, `slack`, `notion`, `googlecalendar`.
   Org-global, read-only. (`lemma connectors list` / `get`.)
2. **Auth config** — the org's **credential setup** for one connector: which
   provider, which OAuth app or API-key scheme. **One auth config per (org,
   connector)**, identified by a name you choose (`workspace-gmail`). Every
   operation/trigger command is scoped by **this name**, not the bare connector id.
3. **Account** — a **per-user connected credential** under an auth config (one
   OAuth account, one bot token). Each pod member connects their own; a workload
   resolves *the invoking user's* account automatically.
4. **Operation** / **Trigger** — what you can *do* (`gmail_send_email`,
   `chat_post_message`) and what can *wake* the pod (`new email received`). Both
   are **provider-specific** — see below.

**Provider — LEMMA vs COMPOSIO.** Many connectors (gmail, slack, notion,
googlecalendar, googledrive) ship through **two providers**: `LEMMA` (native) and
`COMPOSIO`. The org picks one when it creates the auth config, and **that choice
determines the operation and trigger set** — operation ids *and* payload shapes
differ between providers. A payload that works on COMPOSIO will not work on LEMMA
and vice versa. The auth-config *name* encodes the provider choice, which is why
every command is keyed by it.

**Delegated identity.** When a function or agent runs, it acts as the user who
invoked it (`pod-model.md` → delegated identity). So a granted connector resolves
to *that user's* connected account. The workload only needs the
`connector.use` grant; it never sees, stores, or passes the credential.

## Find the auth-config name first — `overview`

Operations and triggers are addressed by **auth-config name** and differ per
provider, so the one thing you must get right is that name. `overview` is the
single place to find it:

```bash
lemma connectors overview     # table: App | Auth Config | Provider | Status | Accounts
lemma connectors status       # same facts, your installed apps + your connected accounts
```

`overview` prints one row per installed auth config — the **Auth Config** column is
the exact string to pass to `operations` and `triggers`. If only one auth config
exists, the CLI auto-discovers it and you can omit the name.

## Set up a connector (CLI — not bundles)

Connectors are **org/pod runtime state and do NOT round-trip in bundles**
(`pod-model.md` → authoring). Set them up by CLI and record the commands in the
pod README so anyone can reconnect after import.

```bash
# 1. Browse the catalog
lemma connectors list
lemma connectors get gmail

# 2. Create the org auth config (required before any operation/trigger command)
lemma connectors auth-configs create gmail --name workspace-gmail        # --provider LEMMA (default) | COMPOSIO
lemma connectors auth-configs list
lemma connectors auth-configs get workspace-gmail

# 3a. OAuth app: open a connect-request link, user completes it in the browser
lemma connectors connect-requests create gmail --auth-config-id <auth-config-id>
lemma connectors accounts list --app gmail            # confirm an account appears

# 3b. Token / API-key app: create the account directly with credentials
lemma connectors accounts create --auth-config workspace-gmail --file payloads/account.json

# Confirm the whole picture
lemma connectors overview
```

`auth-configs` and `accounts` both support `list` / `get` / `create` / `delete`.

## Discover → execute (never guess)

The discovery loop is non-negotiable: operation ids and payload keys are
provider-specific, so **search by intent, read the schema, then execute**.

```bash
# 1. Search by intent — returns ranked matches for THIS auth config's provider
lemma connectors operations search workspace-gmail "send email" --limit 5

# 2. Read the input schema (one or more ops; --details for the whole batch)
lemma connectors operations get workspace-gmail gmail_send_email
lemma connectors operations details workspace-gmail gmail_send_email slack_chat_post_message

# 3. Execute — payload goes under "payload"; pin an account only when needed
lemma connectors operations execute workspace-gmail gmail_send_email \
  --data '{"payload": {"recipient_email": "a@b.com", "subject": "Hi", "body": "Test"}}'

lemma connectors operations execute workspace-gmail gmail_send_email \
  --account <account-id> --file payloads/send.json
```

- `operations search` scans names + descriptions and returns ranked hits **for the
  auth config's provider only**. `operations list` is the same with no query.
- `operations get` shows one operation's input schema; `operations details` takes
  several names (or none → every operation) and returns their schemas as a batch.
- Operation names are **case-insensitive** for `get`/`details`/`execute`, but use
  the spelling `search` returned (`gmail_send_email`, not a guessed
  `GMAIL_SEND_EMAIL`).
- `execute` expects the operation payload under a top-level `"payload"` key; pass
  `--account <id>` to pin a specific connected account, otherwise the invoking
  user's account is resolved.

**Not sure which operation?** Ask the helper agent — it reads the catalog and
returns a concrete plan with operation ids and payloads:

```bash
lemma tools connector-helper-agent "send tomorrow's calendar summary by email" \
  --app googlecalendar --app gmail
```

## Skill guide per connector

Each connector ships a generated skill doc **per provider**. Fetch it before
writing payloads — it auto-resolves the provider from your installed auth config:

```bash
lemma connectors describe gmail              # provider auto-detected from the auth config
lemma connectors describe gmail --provider composio   # force a provider
```

(SDK: `pod.connectors.apps.skill("gmail", provider="lemma")`.)

## From functions and agents

Grant the connector to the workload, then call it with the **auth-config name** and
the payload you tested in the CLI. The grant is by connector id, name-based and
portable across pods:

```json
{ "resource_type": "connector", "resource_name": "gmail",
  "permission_ids": ["connector.use"] }
```

`lemma agents grant <agent> app:gmail:use` writes the same grant (the `app:`
shorthand maps to `connector`). Then in code:

```python
# Send an email as the invoking user
sent = pod.connectors.execute(
    "workspace-gmail",                 # auth-config NAME, not the bare "gmail"
    "gmail_send_email",                # operation id from `operations search`
    {"recipient_email": data.to, "subject": data.subject, "body": data.body},
).to_dict()["result"]

# Post to Slack
pod.connectors.execute(
    "workspace-slack", "chat_post_message",
    {"channel": "C123", "text": "Triage complete — 3 tickets resolved."},
)
```

- The response is `{"result": ...}` — unwrap with `.to_dict()["result"]`.
- **Don't pass `account_id` in code** unless you must pin one. The backend resolves
  the configured fixed account or the invoking user's connected account from the
  workload token. If the user has no connected account, the call fails with an
  account-resolution error — let that surface unless there's a meaningful fallback.
- Agents granted the connector get an operation toolset automatically; agents with
  the `WORKSPACE_CLI` toolset can also run the `lemma connectors operations …`
  commands themselves.

(App side — calling a connector operation from a browser app, with discovery and a
safe action button → `app-recipes/connector-action.md`.)

## Triggers

A connector also exposes **triggers** — events that can wake a pod (`new email
received`, `message posted`). Like operations, triggers are **scoped to an auth
config** and returned for that config's provider only:

```bash
lemma connectors triggers list workspace-gmail              # provider-scoped
lemma connectors triggers list workspace-gmail -q "new email"
lemma connectors triggers get workspace-gmail <trigger-id>  # full config + payload schema
```

A trigger id is **provider-qualified**: `{app}:{provider}:{slug}` (e.g.
`gmail:composio:new_message`). Wire a trigger to an agent or workflow with a
**WEBHOOK schedule** — see `schedules-and-triggers.md`. A trigger needs a
**connected account** to deliver events.

## Patterns

- **Outbound action from a workload.** Function/agent grants `connector.use`,
  executes one operation (send email, post message, create event) on the user's
  account. The hands-on half of most pods.
- **Inbound event → automation.** A connector trigger + WEBHOOK schedule +
  `filter_instruction` starts a workflow on real-world events (see
  `schedules-and-triggers.md`).
- **Surface.** A connector account also backs an **agent surface** (Slack/Gmail/…)
  — same account, different consumer. See `surfaces.md`.

## Limits & gotchas

- **Not in bundles.** Auth configs, accounts, and connect state are org/pod runtime
  state — `pods import` won't recreate them. Script the setup in the README, or a
  connector-using bundle is incomplete.
- **One auth config per (org, connector).** A second `auth-configs create` for the
  same connector fails — reuse or `delete` first.
- **Provider determines everything.** Re-check operation ids and payloads with
  `operations details` whenever you switch providers; never reuse names across them.
- **Wrong/foreign auth-config name.** `operations search` returning not-found
  usually means the name is wrong or the auth config belongs to another org. Run
  `lemma connectors overview` to read the exact name.
- **Account required for events.** Triggers (and surfaces) need a connected account
  before they deliver anything.

## Verify

```bash
lemma connectors overview                          # auth config + accounts wired?
# read-only smoke test of one operation:
lemma connectors operations execute workspace-gmail <read-only-op> --data '{"payload": {}}'
# then verify the delegated workload path end-to-end:
lemma functions run <fn-that-calls-the-connector> --data '{...}'
```
